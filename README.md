# Clustering_Our_World_with_TSNE

Here's the part of the data cleaning and analysis of <b>THE WORLD DATA VISUALIZATION PRIZE</b>. To explore the dataset of index values and indicators of what every countries of the world is and analyze how cluster they are.

### Objective 🎯
1. To visualize clusters of data for insights of it
2. Evaluate indexes each topics that are considered (<em>This is excluded to present here. It will be presented through the web project that another team member is implementing.</em>)

### Process 📊
1. Gathering the data into one file
2. Cleaning and imputing data (<b>required</b>)
3. Manipulating and managing needed variables in dataset for analysis
4. Reducing variables by clustering method (Here using t-SNE) for generating visulization
5. Visulizing clusters of data

### Problems 🗣️
1. Datasets had come from many sources. It is difficult to detect a fraud, valid a proper value and correct labels.
2. To use t-SNE for clustering, dataset must be completed. Hence, imputating is necessary but it might cause a lack of correctness.<br>

### Result
Here's the plots of clustering analysis.
